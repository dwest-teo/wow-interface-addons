Tag as v4.0.11


--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Remove innervate aura, the spell no longer exists
	- Remove unregister of UNIT_NAME_UPDATE in split group headers as well
	- Don't unregister UNIT_NAME_UPDATE on group headers anymore.
	This fixed an issue in WoW 3.x which does not exist anymore, and has
	in fact caused issues with raid members not being displayed reliably
	after joining a group since MoP.
